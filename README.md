# 30_Days_Deeplearning



## Day 1 
  #### Multi Layered Perceptron 
  
  <em>Summary -  It is a class of feedforward Neural Network. Atleast contains 3 layers, Input layer, Hidden Layer, Output Layer for more information refer [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilayer_perceptron)</em>
   
  The there main type of the layers refer to 
  <ul>
    <em>
      <li>Input Layer</li>
      <li>Hidden Layer</li>
      <li>Output Layer</li>
    </em>
  </ul>

  <em><u> Input Layer </u> :-</em>
        This layer refer to the place where we feed attributes to our Neural Network, this is where our features will be feed and propogate through the layers to
        genereate output for our neural network.
        <p>For more information refer this [link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32514502/neural-networks-what-does-the-input-layer-consist-of)</p>
        
   <em><u>Hidden Layer :-</u> </em>
        <p>This is the layer that is present between your input layer and output layer, this is where you apply weights to inputs and then directs them through the
        activation functions. Now the question arises what is an activation function, the activation function refers to the function where we apply some kind of 
        transformation to data so that we can make use of it as inputs to next layers and inturn getting answers. </p>

There are many type of Activation Functions that can be choosed to apply on your data. Refer this [link](https://towardsdatascience.com/activation-functions-neural-networks-1cbd9f8d91d6)
